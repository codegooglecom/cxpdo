= How To Use CXPDO Functions =

Each of the added functions CXPDO provides takes a series of parameters/arguments and returns a PDO Statement Object. Here is a list of all variables that CXPDO requires and what they are supposed to hold/be.

*$tables* = string or array of table names that the query is affecting. In some cases only one table name is allowed.

*$data* = array where $key => $element. $key = column name and $element = data

*$replace* = Should the term REPLACE be used instead of INSERT? TRUE/FALSE

*$return* = TRUE = DO NOT QUERY DB! Create query string and return it. (Default) FALSE = query db and return result. This is very handy for checking syntax and learning how to write SQL.


== Insert($tables, $data, $replace, $return) ==

  * $tables = Array
  * $data = Array
  * $replace = TRUE/FALSE
  * $return = TRUE/FALSE
